This dashboard provides an overview of the COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic.

# Data

The dataset for this dashboard is from website called [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). 

The source of vaccination data can be found at the Our World in [DataÂ vaccination github repo](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations).


# SQL and Tableau

I used Excel and SQL to clean and reorganize the data, and the used Tableau to visualize the data. The SQL scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/BinkeWang123/Covid-19-Dashboard/blob/main/Covid-19%20Dashboard%20Scripts).

1. At the top of the page, I created a navigation bar with the tableau. You can view the different charts by clicking on the buttons.

2. In the ranking dashboard, I created a drop-down menu. You can click on the different kinds of data to get their rankings.

3. In the dashboard about vaccine information, I created a row of navigation bars similar to the bookmarks. You can see very visually the three charts included in the vaccine information dashboard. By clicking on the buttons, you can get different charts.

4. On the form page for vaccine data, I specifically built in a page navigation bar. You can click on the page numbers to jump through the table pages. This can split particularly long tables and allow people to see the table data in a better way.
